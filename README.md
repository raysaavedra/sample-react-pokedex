## Other Info

- Error View

I didn't include a test error on data fetching, but it should show when state is set to true.

- Test

Used enzyme

- jsconfig.json

this includes fix for absolute imports in create-react-app

- How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?

Breakdown major UI parts in the app to properly create the components and the components that are reusable. 
Identify the states used in a component
Identify the parent - child components and how to pass data

- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

yes, create a class for pokemon object. Properly fix the css/bootsrap part of the UI.

- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

implement react-hooks
will probably use material UI vs bootstrap or if I will stick to bootstrap, will use react-bootstrap.
I could have done better with the css and layout
